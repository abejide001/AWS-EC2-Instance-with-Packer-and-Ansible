# AWS-EC2-Instance-with-Packer-and-Ansible

A project using packer to build an image and ansible for configuration management

## How to Setup the application on your machine

- Create an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), if you don't have one
- Select Services from the menu bar and click on `IAM(Identity Access Management)` which is under Security, Identity, & Compliance
- Select User and add a user by entering the username, this will be enable to get an access and a secret key
- Ensure you have packer installed by running the command on the terminal 
```bash
$ packer -v
```
- Clone the github repository
- Copy the content of the .env.sample file(aws_access_key and aws_secret_key)
- Export the variables in the terminal by running the command 
```bash 
$ export aws_access_key=myaccesskey
``` 
and 
```bash 
$ export aws_secret_key=mysecretkey
```
- To confirm the variables are in the environment, run the command 
```bash 
$ env
```
it will display the variables
- Run the command 
```bash
$ packer validate packer.json
``` 
to validate the packer.json
- Run the command 
```bash 
$ packer build packer.json
``` 
to build the image, this will take a while to run, once this is successful, you will see the AMI name and id on the terminal
## How to Create an Instance with the AMI(Automated Machine Image) Created
- After successfully running the command, go to your dashboard on aws, select **Services**, under services, select **EC2**, which is under compute, under the EC2 dashboard, select **AMI's**, you will see the the AMI that was just being created

 - Create a key-value pair by selecting `create new key-pair`, enter the `key-pair` name, and download the `key-pair` to your machine if you don't have one, so you can get RSA Key that will enable you SSH into the instance or select `choose existing key-pair` in the dropdown if you have already created one, you can also proceed without a key pair, click on the **launch instance** button, this will take about 2mins for the instance to be ready
- After the instance is created, select the instances on the **EC2 dashboard**

- Go to the terminal and ssh into the instance by running the command ```ssh -i demo-packer.pem.txt ubuntu@3.16.154.225```, `demo-packer.pem.txt` representing where the key is store.
- Now you can access the application via the IP `3.16.154.225`
